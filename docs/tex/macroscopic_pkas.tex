\section{Macroscopic pKas for a single ligand species}

We would like to use the calculated effective energy differences to
determine macroscopic pKas (i.e. the equilibrium constant that
describes the populations of various macrostates). We will use proton
binding as an example but note that this derivation can apply to any
binding ligand as long as it is the sole binding species.

We define the macroscopic pKa as:

\begin{equation}
  pKa_m \equiv -\log \left(\frac{[C^-][H^+]}{[CH] c_0} \right)
\end{equation}

Where $[C^-]$ is the concentration of protonated complexes, $[H^+]$ is
the concentration of protons, $[CH]$ is the concentration of
protonated complexes, and $c_0$ is the standard state concentration of
hydrogen. Using the properties of logarithmic functions:

\begin{align*}
  pKa_m &\equiv -\log \left(\frac{[C^-][H^+]}{[CH] c_0} \right) \\
  &= -\log \left( \frac{[C^-]}{[CH]} \right) + pH \\
  &= -\log \left(\frac{P(C^-)}{P(CH)} \right) + pH \\
  &= -\ln \left( \frac{P(C^-)}{P(CH)}/\ln(10) \right) + pH \\
  &= -\frac{-\beta \Delta G_{C^-,CH}}{\ln 10} + pH
\end{align*}

where $\Delta G_{C^-,CH}$ is the effective free energy difference of
protonation, which is: 

\begin{equation}
\Delta G_{N-1,N} = \beta^{-1} \ln \left[ \frac{\sum_s \exp(-\beta
    \Delta G_s)\delta_{N_s,N-1}}{\sum_s \exp(-\beta \Delta
    G_s)\delta_{N_s,N}} \right]
\end{equation}

where the $\delta_{N_s,N}$ and $\delta_{N_s,N-1}$ will pick out states
that contain the correct number of protonated residues.
